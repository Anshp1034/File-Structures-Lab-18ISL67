# File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67
I have added programs of File Structures Lab in C++ for Information Science and Engineering Students

Consider Visual Studio to run these programs

# Programs List

| Sl. No. | Program | Links |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Program 1: Write a C++ program to read series of names,one per line,from standard input and write these names spelled in reverse order to the standard output using I/O redirection and pipes. Repeat the exercise using an input file specified by the user instead of the standard input and using an output file specified by the user instead of the standard output.| [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/1.cpp) |
| 2 | Program 2: Write a C++ program to read and write and student objects with fixed-length records and the fields delimited by "|".Implement pack(),unpack(),modify() and search() methods.  | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/2.cpp) |
| 3 | Program 3: Write a C++ program to read and write and student objects with variable-length records using any suitable record structure. Implement pack(),unpack(),modify() and search() methods| [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/3.cpp) |
| 4 | Program 4: Write a c++ program to write student objects with variable-length records using any suitable record structure and to read from this file a student record using RRN. | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/4.cpp) |
| 5 | Program 5: Write a C++ program to implement simple index on primary key for a file of student objects. Implement add(),search(),delete() using the index. | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/5.cpp) |
| 6 | Program 6: Write a C++ program to implement index on secondary key, the name, for a file of student objects. Implement add(),search(),delete() using the secondary index. | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/6.cpp) |
| 7 | Program 7: Write a C++ program to read two lists of names and then match the names in the two lists using Consequential Match based on a single loop. Output the names common to both the lists. | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/7.cpp) |
| 8 | Program 8: Write a C++ program to read k Lists of names and merge them using kway merge algorithm with k = 8. | [click me](https://github.com/Anshp1034/File-Structures-Lab-18ISL67/blob/main/18ISL67/8.cpp) |
